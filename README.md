## About dataset

 Repository of data on protein adsorption to polymeric self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) by Ostuni et al., originally published May 22nd, 2001. Please read the original reference for more information about methods used to produce this dataset.

## Description of data

The dataset is stored in a comma-separated values file (Whitesides_data.csv). Property data are extracted from the original reference. SMILES notations are added by myself in agreement with materials included in the dataset. Adsorption data presented as the percent of a monolayer of protein adsorbed onto mixed SAM.

Description of variables:
- Sample Number - Order presented in original dataset
- SMILES - Linear notation of material chemistries
- Fibrinogen-3 - %ML of Fibrinogen at 3 minutes
- Fibrinogen-30 - %ML of Fibrinogen at 30 minutes
- Lysozyme-3 - %ML of Lysozyme at 3 minutes
- Lysozyme-30 - %ML of Lysozyme at 30 minutes
